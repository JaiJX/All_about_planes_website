            <h1>How Planes Work</h1>
            <p>
                Airplanes are complex machines that are designed to fly by using the forces of aerodynamics. The four main forces acting
                on an airplane are lift, weight, thrust, and drag. For a plane to take off and stay in the air, lift must be greater
                than weight, and thrust must be greater than drag.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="HPWpara2">
            <p>
                Lift is created by the wings. Airplane wings are shaped so that air moves faster over the top of the wing than
                underneath it. This difference in air speed creates lower pressure above the wing and higher pressure below it, pushing
                the plane upward. The angle at which the wing meets the air, called the angle of attack, also helps generate lift.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="HPWpara3">
            <p>
                Thrust is the force that moves the airplane forward. It is produced by the engines, which can be jet engines or
                propellers. Jet engines work by sucking in air, compressing it, mixing it with fuel, and igniting it to produce a
                powerful stream of exhaust that pushes the plane forward. Propeller engines work by spinning blades that push air
                backward, creating forward motion.

        <div class="HPWpara4">

                Drag is the resistance the airplane experiences as it moves through the air. Engineers design airplanes with smooth
                shapes and lightweight materials to reduce drag and improve fuel efficiency. Weight is the force of gravity pulling the
                airplane downward, and it includes the mass of the plane, passengers, cargo, and fuel.

                Pilots control airplanes using movable surfaces on the wings and tail. The ailerons control rolling left and right, the
                elevators control climbing and descending, and the rudder controls yaw, or left and right turning. Together, these
                controls allow pilots to steer the aircraft safely through the sky.

                Overall, airplanes fly by balancing forces and using carefully designed wings, engines, and control systems. Through a
                combination of physics, engineering, and technology, planes are able to carry people and cargo across long distances
                quickly and safely.
