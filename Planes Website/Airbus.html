            <p><bold>Airbus</bold> is one of the world’s leading aerospace companies and a major manufacturer of commercial airplanes, helicopters,
                military aircraft, and space technology. It was founded in 1970 as a European partnership to compete with American
                aircraft makers, especially Boeing. Today, Airbus is headquartered in Toulouse, France, and operates in many countries
                around the world.

            <p>Airbus is best known for its commercial jetliners, including the A320 family, which is one of the most widely used
                aircraft for short- and medium-distance flights. The company also produces larger airplanes such as the A350 and the
                A330, which are used for long-haul international travel. One of Airbus’s most famous planes was the A380, the world’s
                largest passenger airplane, designed to carry hundreds of passengers on long-distance routes.

            <p>In addition to commercial aviation, Airbus plays an important role in defense and space. It builds military transport
                aircraft like the A400M, satellites for communication and navigation, and spacecraft for scientific missions. Airbus is
                also involved in developing new technologies such as sustainable aviation fuels, electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft,
                and more fuel-efficient designs to reduce the environmental impact of flying.
