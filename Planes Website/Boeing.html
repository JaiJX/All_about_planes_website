            <p><bold>Boeing</bold> is one of the world’s largest and most well-known aerospace companies. It was founded in 1916 by William E.
                Boeing in Seattle, Washington, and has played a major role in the development of aviation for over a century. Today,
                Boeing’s headquarters are in Arlington, Virginia, and the company operates in many countries around the world.

                Boeing is best known for its commercial airplanes, including the 737, 747, 777, and 787 Dreamliner families. The 737 is
                one of the most widely used aircraft for short- and medium-distance flights, while the 777 and 787 are designed for
                long-haul international travel. The iconic 747, often called the “Queen of the Skies,” was the world’s first jumbo jet
                and revolutionized air travel when it entered service in 1970.

                In addition to commercial aviation, Boeing is a major player in defense, space, and security. It builds military
                aircraft such as the F-15 and F/A-18 fighter jets, satellites for communication and navigation, and spacecraft including
                the CST-100 Starliner, which is designed to carry astronauts to the International Space Station. Boeing is also working
                on advanced technologies such as more fuel-efficient airplanes, sustainable aviation fuels, and autonomous flight
                systems.
